# Climate API

## Background
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. This project outlines the steps needed to perform this analysis and create a Flask API to serve the data.

Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration on the provided climate database. All of the following analyses should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The code for this lies in 'climate_starter' file.

Step 2 - Climate App
Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have developed. The code for this lies in 'surfs_up/app'.
